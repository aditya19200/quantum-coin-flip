# Quantum Coin Flip Simulation

## Overview
This Python project demonstrates the difference between quantum and classical coin flipping using Qiskit, a quantum computing library. It provides a fascinating comparison between quantum probabilistic behavior and classical random number generation.

## Features
- Quantum coin flip simulation using Qiskit
- Classical coin flip simulation using Python's random module
- Comparative visualization of results
- Probability analysis of coin flip outcomes

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Qiskit
- Qiskit-aer
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aditya19200/quantum-coin-flip.git
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer matplotlib
```

## How It Works
The script does two things:
1. Performs a quantum coin flip using a Hadamard gate to create a superposition
2. Performs a classical coin flip using Python's random number generator

It then compares and visualizes the results, showing the probabilistic nature of quantum systems.

## Running the Script
```bash
python quantum_coin_flip.py
```

## Key Quantum Mechanics Concept
The Hadamard gate used in this simulation puts a qubit into an equal superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩ states, analogous to a coin spinning in the air before landing.

## Visualization
The script generates two types of plots:
- Histogram of quantum coin flip results
- Histogram of classical coin flip results
- Comparative bar graph of both methods
